1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Summary
Introduction to Covid-19 On 31st December 2019, in the city of Wuhan (CHINA), a cluster 
of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was reported to the World Health organisation. 
In January 2020, a previously unknown new virus was identified, subsequently named 2019 
novel corona virus. WHO has declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. A pandemic is 
defined as disease spread over a wide range of geographical areas and that has affected a 
high proportion of the population.
1.2 Aim and Objectives
Aim
The aim of the project is to provide data analysis of covid-19 (a pandemic started in 
December 2019).
Objectives
In this project, the predictions on various cases have been done and finally, the accuracy of 
the algorithm has been determined. Comparison graphs has also been plotted to analyse 
how much India and World is getting affected/recovering day by day.

1.3 Problem Specifications
Problem Statement The pandemic has already taken grip over peoplesâ€™ life. Since the start 
of the pandemic, some countries are facing problem of ever-increasing cases. Through the 
data analysis of cases one can analyse how India is doing in terms of controlling the 
pandemic. Analysing data leads to adapt the prevention model of the india and world that 
are doing great in terms of lowering the graph. Predictions are made with the dataset 
available to the individual/organisations, thus helping them to decide how far they are able 
to control the pandemic or up to how much extent they should guide preventive measures

1.4 Literature Review and Prior Art Search (PAS). 
The corona virus COVID-19 originated from Wuhan, the city in central China. The 
symptoms of corona virus are fever, cough and shortness of breath. It typically causes flulike symptoms. In some patients particularly the elders and others with other chronic health 
conditions- these, symptoms can develop into pneumonia, with chest tightness, chest pain 
and shortness of breath. It seems to start with a fever, followed by a drug cough. After a 
week it can lead to shortness of breath, with about 20% patients requiring hospital 
treatment.

2. Analysis, Design Methodology and Implementation 
Strategy
2.1 Analysis
In this analysis, we have taken Covid-19 data of World. Analysis is done for India and 
whole world, graphs with highest deaths, confirmed cases are presented.
2.2 Methodology 
In our project we have taken live dataset which will be keep on updating on time intervals. 
Which will be beneficial for us to do analysis using this live data that keeps updating 
whereas in offline dataset is the data is stored offline and not updated and analysis is only 
done on this particular data. After getting to this point we have performed analysis using 
python code where we partitioned data by dividing it for India and another whole data for 
world. So it will do analysis for India and whole world accordingly. Then after we have 
visualized data in map using calmap and folium libraries where map of India is shown in 
output containing related details in form of lists and same for whole world.

2.3 Implementation Strategy
In this project we have worked to analyse the data for India and world for this pandemic 
which whole world has faced and lot of data is generated due to this we thought to analyse 
this data that will show a result in effective manner. Visualizing the data in graphs, map 
which makes clear vision of user about past period of covid19 and can get related details 
easily on moving the cursor. Our goal is to give accurate results and visualize the data 
which was generated and using it in effective way. We created python model that analyse 
the data which has been provided as per requirement and performed visualization on data.
